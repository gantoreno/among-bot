# MuteBot: A Discord bot to play Among Us the right way

This bot will easily toggle the entire voice channel's mute state, so that no one is able to speak when it's not supposed to (i.e. during Among Us parties).

## Usage

Start the bot with:

```sh
$ npm start
```

To mute everyone, type on the chat:

```
-m
```

And this will toggle an immutable mute state. To unmute, type:

```
-u
```

And everything will go back to normal.
